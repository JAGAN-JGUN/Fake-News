# Fake News Detection

This project focuses on detecting fake news using deep learning models such as CNN, LSTM, and ensemble techniques. It involves data preprocessing, model training, and performance evaluation.

## 📁 Project Structure

- `CNN.py` – Convolutional Neural Network implementation.
- `LSTM.py` – Long Short-Term Memory model implementation.
- `ENSEMBLE.py` – Combines multiple models to improve performance.
- `Preprocessing.py` – Prepares data for model training.
- `Data/` – Contains `train.csv`, `test.csv`, and `submit.csv`.

## 🚀 Features

- End-to-end fake news classification pipeline
- Word embedding and tokenization
- Model training and evaluation
- Ensemble prediction strategy

## 🧪 Models Used

- CNN (Convolutional Neural Network)
- LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)
- Ensemble (Hybrid model combining multiple approaches)
